# LITEFLIX

Enjoy from your house like a cinema

## Getting started

Let's run our app in local ðŸš€

```
yarn dev or npm run dev
```

## Development details

The application was developed using nextjs v13. Using server components along with the new appDir functionality (in Beta).
It's a bit cumbersome the folder architecture maybe since following what the 'vercel' people suggest we opted to put all the application content inside the 'app' folder. Perhaps it is a bit confusing as now the paths are there too. I could have put everything outside this folder but having the api in the same project could make everything even more confusing.
